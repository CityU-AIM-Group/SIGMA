The main idea of the series of works: *Model fine-grained feature points with graphs.* We 
 sincerely appreciate for all the readers showing interest in our works. 

Honestly, due to the limited personal ability, our works still have many limitations, e.g., sub-optimal and redundant designs. Please forgive me. Nevertheless, we hope our works can inspire lots of good idea.

## üì¶ Well-trained models

The ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 backbone (w/o BN) is available at [link](https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/wuyangli2-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/ESOgJbvystdDiGbMLiGnL50BvxxwSJ3LjR22yxo9-OdTOA?e=5cA2xY). You can use it if you cannot download the model through the link in the config file. \
The well-trained models are available at this [link](https://portland-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wuyangli2-c_my_cityu_edu_hk/Eh94jXa1NSxAilUAE68-T0MBckTxK3Tm-ggmzZRJTHNHww?e=B30DNw)).

1) We can get higher results than the reported ones with tailor-tuned hyperparameters.
2) E2E indicates end-to-end training for better reproducibility. Our config files are used for end-to-end training.
3) Two-stage/ longer training and turning learning rate will make the results more stable and get higer mAP/AP75.
4) After correcting a default hyper-parameter (as explained in the config file), Sim10k to City achieves better results than the reported ones.
5) You can set MODEL.MIDDLE_HEAD.GM.WITH_CLUSTER_UPDATE False to accelerate training greatly with ignorable performance drops. You'd better also make this change for bs=2 since we found it more friendly for the small batch-size training.
6) Results will be stable after the learning rate decline (in the training schedule).

## üìí Abstract

Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) leverages a labeled source domain to learn an object detector generalizing to a novel target domain free of annotations. Recent advances align class-conditional distributions through narrowing down cross-domain prototypes (class centers). Though great success, these works ignore the significant within-class variance and the domain-mismatched semantics within the training batch, leading to a sub-optimal adaptation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel SemantIc-complete Graph MAtching (SIGMA) framework for DAOD, which completes mismatched semantics and reformulates the adaptation with graph matching. Specifically, we design a Graph-embedded Semantic Completion module (GSC) that completes mismatched semantics through generating hallucination graph nodes in missing categories. Then, we establish cross-image graphs to model class-conditional distributions and learn a graph-guided memory bank for better semantic completion in turn. After representing the source and target data as graphs, we reformulate the adaptation as a graph matching problem, i.e., finding well-matched node pairs across graphs to reduce the domain gap, which is solved with a novel Bipartite Graph Matching adaptor (BGM). In a nutshell, we utilize graph nodes to establish semantic-aware node affinity and leverage graph edges as quadratic constraints in a structure-aware matching loss, achieving fine-grained adaptation with a node-to-node graph matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing works significantly.
